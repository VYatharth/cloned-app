                    I'm a web designer and developer based in Southampton, UK. During the day I work as a lead developer at a local agency and in the evening I work on freelance projects and utilize the time to built my own products. I spent my leisure hours writing articles and poetry. Right now I'm also trying a hand at machine learning and AI. I love to learn and explore new arenas.
